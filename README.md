# Heart-Disease-Prediction
🚀 Embarking on my journey into AI in Healthcare, I'm thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project: "Heart Disease Prediction! 📊 In this endeavor, I delved into healthcare data to uncover patterns and forecast instances of heart disease. Harnessing Python and a range of machine learning algorithms, I conducted thorough analyses and crafted predictive models to detect potential occurrences of Heart Disease.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Investigated demographic attributes such as age and sex.
- Explored medical factors including Chest pain type, Resting blood pressure, Serum cholesterol, fast blood sugar, Resting electrocardiographic results, Maximum heart rate achieved, Excercise-induced angina, Number of major vessels.

📈 Model Training:
- Implemented a diverse array of machine learning models, including Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Process, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Net, AdaBoost, Xgboost, CatBoost, Naive Bayes Gaussian, SVM Linear, SVM RBF, SVM Sigmoid.
- Assessed model performances utilizing metrics such as Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall, and AUC Score.

💡 Key Insights:
- Discovered that males exhibit an 88% higher likelihood of developing heart disease compared to females.
- Identified a correlation between advancing age (specifically in the older age range) and an elevated risk of heart disease.

🌟 Achievements:
- Attained impressive accuracy scores with models like SVM RBF (88.33%), Gaussian Process, and Naive Bayes Gaussian (87%).
- Successfully deployed a predictive model for Heart Disease Prediction.

🔗 Next Steps:
- Plan to explore additional features and data sources to enhance model performance.
- Strive to develop a user-friendly interface for seamless access and utilization of the predictive model.

I am excited to continue navigating the intersection of healthcare and data science! 🩺 📊
